Project Description 
This project encompasses the development of a discord bot that acts as a personal assistent/scheduler. Users can tell the bot tasks and/or events including a title, description, classification (e.g. personal, work, study), due date, and reminder time/date. Users should also be able to undo these operations. The discord bot will then remind users of these tasks and/or events by sending a message to users through a discord chat. The discord bot may also be able to send these events/tasks to the users' Google Calendar (this feature may be omitted). We will be developing with C++ and discord's API.
