Project Description 
This project encompasses the development of a discord bot that acts as a personal assistent/scheduler. This project is interesting becuase it combines a task scheduler and a bot to create a virtual assistant. Users can have the bot create tasks and/or events including a title, description, classification (e.g. personal, work, study), due date, and reminder time/date. Users should be able to edit existing task as well as remove them through commands to the bot. The discord bot will remind users of these tasks and/or events by sending a message to users through a discord chat both on the reminder time/date and due time/date. After the event due date/time has passed, the discord bot will delete the task/event from the users schedule. The discord bot may also be able to send these events/tasks to the users' Google Calendar (this feature may be omitted). We will be developing with C++ and discord's API.
