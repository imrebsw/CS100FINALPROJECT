Project Description 

This project encompasses the development of a discord bot that acts as a personal assistent/scheduler. This project is interesting becuase it combines a task scheduler and a bot to create a virtual assistant. Users can have the bot create tasks and/or events including a title, description, classification (e.g. personal, work, study), due date, and reminder time/date. Users should be able to edit existing task as well as remove them through commands to the bot. The discord bot will remind users of these tasks and/or events by sending a message to users through a discord chat both on the reminder time/date and due time/date. After the event due date/time has passed, the discord bot will delete the task/event from the users schedule. The discord bot may also be able to send these events/tasks to the users' Google Calendar (this feature may be omitted). We will be developing with C++ and discord's API.

UML Decription:
This class Diagram shows the manner which the structure classes and main Event class will interact with one another. The Event class will be using the variables from the structure classes to process and display the given information for specific events created in the discord server. These events will have different classification categories depending on the server and the user's needs. NOTE: This is not the final design for the UML Diagram, we will be updating this diagram as more discussion occurs and as the project progresses.
